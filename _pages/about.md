I'm a graduate student from [School of ISEE](http://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes NeuroAI, robust optimization, AI for science, wireless communications, etc.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chongwen Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Huang-Chongwen/stats) in institude of information, communication and network engineering, Zhejiang University.

My research focus is optimization algorithm in intelligent communications, especially neuron-inspired optimization methods. Specifically, I have developed an ODE-based flexible neural network beamforming architecture to enhance robustness in dynamic and noisy environments. Besides, I proposed a training-free meta-learning architecture that collaborates the optimization of phase shifting matrix and precoding matrix in RIS-aided communications, which has been accepted and orally presented at _IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2024_. Moreover, an upgraded version of this work has been accepted by _IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications 2024_. I also hold five patents, which are currently under review by the State Intellectual Property Office.

If you are interested in my works, please refer [my publications](https://tp1000d.github.io/XWang/publications/) for papers and [my patents](https://tp1000d.github.io/XWang/patents/) for patents.
