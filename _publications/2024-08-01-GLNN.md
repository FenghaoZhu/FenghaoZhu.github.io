Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication with the advanced beamforming technologies is a key enabler to meet the growing demands of future mobile communication. However, the dynamic nature of cellular channels in large-scale urban mmWave MIMO communication scenarios brings substantial challenges, particularly in terms of complexity and robustness.

In this paper, we proposed the gradient-based liquid neural network (GLNN) method to solve the beamforming problem in mmWave massive MIMO communication. This scheme combines manifold learning techniques and the LNN with a gradient-based learning approach to form a unified framework.
