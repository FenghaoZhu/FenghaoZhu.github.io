Accurate localization of mobile terminals is crucialfor integrated sensing and communication systems. Existing fingerprint localization methods, which deduce coordinates fromchannel information in pre-defined rectangular areas, strug-gle with the heterogeneous fingerprint distribution inherent innon-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. To address the problem,we introduce a novel multi-source information fusion learning framework referred to as the Autosync Multi-Domain NLOSLocalization (AMDNLoc). Specifically, AMDNLoc employs a two-stage matched filter fused with a target tracking algorithm and iterative centroid-based clustering to automatically and irregularly segment NLOS regions, ensuring uniform fingerprint distribution within channel state information across frequency,power, and time-delay domains. Additionally, the framework uti-lizes a segment-specific linear classifier array, coupled with deep residual network-based feature extraction and fusion, to establish the correlation function between fingerprint features and coordinates within these regions. Simulation results demonstrate that AMDNLoc significantly enhances localization accuracy by over 55% compared with traditional convolutional neural network onthe wireless artificial intelligence research dataset.
